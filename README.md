## My process
Here, I talk a bit about the tools I built this project with, as well the things I learnt and the plan I have to improve in this field.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flex
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned more about how CSS could be manipulated. I also learnt a new font style(Fraunces), as well as new color grading options.

```css
.learnt-these {
  color: color: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
  font-family: 'Fraunces', serif;
}
```

### Continued development
For now, I plan to learn more about the capabilities of the CSS flex(and grid) properties.
